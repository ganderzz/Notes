## React Boilerplate

A React boilerplate I use to create React apps. Comes opinionated.

**Tools:**
* React
* Typescript
* Redux
* Prettier
* Webpack
* Jest


### How To

To start development server: `yarn start`

This will create an express server at *127.0.0.1:3000* with Webpack hotloading. Webpack will rebuild any changes on page refresh.
